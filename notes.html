            <p>Finding a job was pretty rough at first, took awhile (3 months) to get that first job. when he got the job, his first work was pair programming with another developer and solving tickets under the view of a senior developer.  </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Did you do any coding while looking for a job?</h3>
        <p>The bootcamp does a great job of keeping you moving. once you're gone, it's difficult to keep up the pace of learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Robert graduated in july of last year, and started working a month later. during the bootcamp, he saw stuff he was interested in and put it in his back pocket for later. after the bootcamp, he made little side projects to keep himself working</p>
